# PronoFoot

PronoFoot is a website designed to organize sports pools, especially for football (hence the name!).

It is a hobby project and also a technical playground. It is an opportunity for me to test things. As a result, it is neither well-architectured, nor bug free!

I don't think it is useful to anyone. But if you think it is, or could be with some changes, let me know!
